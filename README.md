# ATM_ReactBasicProject

This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) project implemented using React. The project allows users to perform basic deposit and cashback transactions.
Description
The project initially featured a basic interface with separate buttons for deposit and cashback transactions. However, improvements were made to enhance user experience and functionality:

Transaction Mode Selection
Instead of separate buttons, a select input element was introduced to allow users to switch between Deposit and Cash Back modes. This provides a clear distinction between the two transaction types.

Input Validation
A validation mechanism was implemented to prevent invalid transactions. For example, the user cannot withdraw more money than the account balance. If an invalid transaction is attempted, an alert message is displayed to notify the user.

Usage
Open the ATM application.
Select the desired transaction mode (Deposit or Cash Back) from the dropdown menu.
Enter the transaction amount in the input field.
Click the "Submit" button to complete the transaction.
If the transaction is invalid (e.g., negative balance or excessive withdrawal), an alert message will be shown.
This project demonstrates how to create a user-friendly ATM interface with improved transaction modes and input validation. It provides a foundation for building more advanced banking applications.
